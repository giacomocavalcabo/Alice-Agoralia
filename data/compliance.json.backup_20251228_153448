[2][3] These sources, however, are secondary legal and policy commentaries and not official government or regulatory texts, so they cannot be relied on to answer with certainty whether AI disclosure is required or not required specifically for quote-request telemarketing calls, nor whether there are distinctions between existing customers and cold calls. [2][3] Because direct consultation of current Ethiopian government portals, official gazettes, or regulatory authority sites is not available in this context, the existence or absence of narrowly tailored AI disclosure rules for telemarketing quote requests cannot be verified, and no clear exceptions can be documented."
